Starting in April 2024, New Game+ worked alongside the Cometh Studio team to develop an in-depth creative strategy, negotiate pricing, and manage the agreed deliverables over the course of 8 weeks. During Chapter 1 of Season 2: Stellarys, 12 creators were employed to showcase Cosmik Battle gameplay and Cometh Studio’s web3 initiatives.

The initial goals for the Cosmik Battle: Season 2 campaign were to strengthen Cosmik Battle’s band awareness, drive acquisition of a qualitative audience, and build legitimacy in the TCG and web3 gaming space. The key messaging of this campaign included portraying Cosmik Battle as the perfect blend of a web2 game loop with advanced gameplay enabled by blockchain technology.

The Cosmik Battle Season 2 Campaign exceeded expectations of web3 awareness and player sentiment for Cosmik Battle. This awareness contributed to the 10k+ player base and 100k+ games played, proving that Cosmik Battle is in a great position for further growth. Creators involved in this campaign and external KOLs also expressed significant interest in playing the game and becoming long-term ambassadors.
