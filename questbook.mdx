Over the span of three months, New Game+ was tasked with allocating 37,500 USD from the Arbitrum Foundation grant to oversee influencer campaigns, live experiences, and content strategy advising. &#x20;

Each month, our target was to generate 15,000 click-throughs, with a total spend management of 100,000 USD approved by the Questbook Council.

In the 3-month period, our team engaged with every major web3 gaming ecosystem and studio on Arbitrum. Our solution was to offer New Game+ as a strategy partner, developing creative approaches and managing creators, organizations, and events for their upcoming releases.

At the time of this report being written, the New Game+ team has worked with and is currently working with a total of 15 teams that held an event in the past month or plan to launch an event in the next month. The full list is below:
