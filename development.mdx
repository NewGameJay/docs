  **Countdown to Alpha**: We are targeting April 15th for an Alpha release with the core features available for all users.

## What To Expect
As you explore the documentation and the New Game+ App, keep in mind that this React Application was developed by one amateur developer, Josh Flores.

The design you will experience was expertly crafted by the New Game+ Senior Brand Designer, Matt Beukelman.

The copy and messaging was a collaborative effort by Miles Lozano, Kyle Salazar, and Matt Beukelman.

Our focus on the application development is possible because of the advisory by Thing3, Danny Carpio, Mark Mangianelli, Rich Cabrera, and Austin Mckee on all aspects of business, legal, and partnerships.


#### The New Game+ Profile
The New Game+ profiles were designed with growth in mind. We're aiming to build a robust user base in anticipation of our platform's Alpha launch. 

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/hero-light.svg"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/hero-dark.svg"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

Users with New Game+ profiles can customize and share their profile as a showcase of their creator experience or game titles.

By onboarding creators and studios early, we're gauging interest and getting an understanding of the core features users want to see.

#### What You Can Do

<CodeGroup>

```bash Creators
- Sign Up 
- Create profile
- Customize profile
- Share profile

Preview the following pages:
- Dashboard
- My Campaigns
- Deliverables
- Offers
- Payout Portal

```

```bash Studios
yarn global add mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Go to the docs are located (where you can find `mint.json`) and run the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

The documentation website is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Mintlify runs on. For example, use this command to run in port 3333:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Mintlify in a port that's already taken:

```md
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

## Mintlify Versions

Each CLI is linked to a specific version of Mintlify. Please update the CLI if your local website looks different than production.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Unlimited editors available under the [Pro
  Plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing) and above.
</Tip>

You should see the following if the deploy successfully went through:

## Troubleshooting

Here's how to solve some common problems when working with the CLI.
