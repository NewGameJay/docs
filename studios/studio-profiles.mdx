Studio Profiles are customized showcases of a Studio's social accounts, official links, and game titles displayed in profile cards.

After signing up, Studio users are taken through an interactive profile-building experience.

## Game Profiles
Studio users can add multiple Game Profiles to their Studio page. Each Game Profile will contain the game's profile picture, banner, official links, and featured gameplay content.
