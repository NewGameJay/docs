## Current Campaigns
Studios can see a high level list of live campaigns shown with the campaign title, the start and end dates, and the Full Offer Values.

A Full Offer Value from the Studio perspective is the total compensation all Creators will receive upon completing a campaign (Or reaching the recurring milestone.)

## Activity Overview
On the Dashboard, Studios can see an overview of their recent content activity, filtered by timeframes. 

The Activity Overview shows Studios a summary of their employed creators contribution and impact. 

Total Impressions, total pieces of content created, total clicks, total engagement, and other relevant information can be found in the Activity Overview.
