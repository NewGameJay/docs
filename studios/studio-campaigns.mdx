Campaigns are the core of the Studio experience in the New Game+ App. 

## New Campaigns
New Campaigns are initiated from the Studio Dashboard to begin the Campaign creation process. 

This process will continue to be improved and innovated to become the best tool for game studios to build the perfect campaign.

### Create Your Campaign
Studios can begin creating their Campaign by answering the foundation questions to any Marketing Campaign.

By building the foundation of a Campaign, Studios will start to understand their goals, target audience, key messaging, and the most effective communication framework.

### Creator Preferences
Studios have the ability to filter for Creators with the content and audience that align best with a Game brand.

Studios can set preferences for platforms, audience size, regions, audience demographics, and more.

### Brief Generator
After completing the Campaign creation process, Studios will have a Campaign Strategy and Creator brief automatically generated.

AI will support Brief Generation by expanding on goals, refining key messaging, and developing detailed Creator Briefs.

Campaign Strategies and Creator Briefs are fully editable and can be customized based on the selected Creator.

### Deliverables Builder
Studios can build sets of deliverables that would effectively contribute to the Campaign Strategy. 

Deliverables will be suggested by the New Game+ logic algorithm. 

Deliverables can also be edited at any time prior to sending an Offer, and can be customized based on the selected Creator.

### Analytics Builder
Studios can utilize a growing list of analytics tools to support Campaigns. 

Analytics tooling like Creator-specific tracking links, landing page or website metrics, and service connections will be included in the Alpha.

### Compatible Creator Tool
Using the Campaign Strategy, Creator Preferences and selected Deliverables, a curated list of Creators will be generated for Studios to review.

Studios can choose to expand their search and override the suggested filters as needed.

## Sending Offers
Offers are proposals for Creators to review and accept or deny. Offers can be sent directly to Creators with customized briefs and deliverables and/or be made available to all Creators in an Open Campaign. 

Offers can be structured in various ways:
 1. Flat Fees
 2. Timed Milestones
 3. Performance Based
 4. Bounty (Open Campaigns Only)
 5. Any mix of the above




Once both parties agree to an Offer, funds will need to be sent to the escrow account or contract to ensure payout security.

### Direct Offers
When a Studio selects a Creator in the Compatible Creator tool, they can send direct offers to the Creator. Prior to sending the Offer, Studios can edit the deliverables, Creator brief, and compensation.

### Open Campaigns
Offers made available to all New Game+ Creators will have a required range of compensation based on the selected Offer structure.

Studios will have the ability to review Creators that apply to Open Campaigns and send a direct offer for the Creator to accept or deny.


## Manage Campaigns
Studios can manage current Campaigns and revise Creator selections, Offers, and Analytics tools. Studios will also be able to review Performance, Creator impact, and the Payout Portal.
