## Current Campaigns
Creators can see a high level list of live campaigns shown with the game title, the campaign title, and the Full Offer Values.

A Full Offer Value is the total compensation the Creator will receive upon completing a campaign (Or reaching the recurring milestone.)

## Activity Overview
On the Dashboard, Creators can see an overview of their recent campaign activity, filtered by timeframes. 

The Activity Overview shows Creators a summary of their performance and contribution. 

Total Impressions, total pieces of content created, total clicks, total engagement, and other relevant information can be found in the Activity Overview.
