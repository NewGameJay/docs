Creator Profiles are personalized showcases of the creators' experience and their preferences.

Creators can start building a  profile by signing up and answering interactive questions  to highlight their favorite gaming genres, social platforms, languages, and even featured content. 

In future builds, users will have access to enhanced profiling features. This will include deeper audience insights, further customization, and preset partnership requests like rates.
