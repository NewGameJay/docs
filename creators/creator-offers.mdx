Offers are partnership proposals that can be sent directly to Creators as campaigns are constructed by game studios.

Offers will contain all campaign details including the studio's game title, reputation, clearly stated deliverables, timelines, terms and expectations. Creators will have the ability to accept or decline after reviewing clearly stated deliverables, timelines, terms and expectations.

## Open Campaigns
Open campaigns are public offers presented to all Creators on New Game+. With one-click, Creators can apply to Open Campaigns for Studios to approve. 

Once a Studio accepts the Creator, New Game+ generates an Offer for Creators in their Received Offers highlighting Campaign details with flat fees and/or performance based bonuses.

## Received Offers
Received Offers are sent directly to Creators that Studios have selected using the Compatible Creator tool or Creator applications. Creators have the ability to accept or decline the Offer after reviewing the Campaign details.

## Campaign Discovery
Creators can explore campaigns across different game studios, with key campaign details available at a glance.

The New Game+ algorithm suggests campaigns that align with the creator's content, engagement style, and past partnerships to boost relevance and engagement rates.


## Pitches and Templates
Pitches are outbound offers sent from Creators to prospective Studio partners. 

If a Creator discovers a Studio or game title they want to work with, Creators can send pitches with creative ideas and requests.

An advanced feature of pitches will be pitch templates. Creators can share and save pitch templates for an easier outbound process.
