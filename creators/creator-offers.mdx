Offers are partnership proposals that can be sent directly to Creators as campaigns are constructed by game studios.

Open campaigns are public offers presented to all creators on New Game+ 

Offers will contain all campaign details including the studio's game title and reputation. Creators will have the ability to accept or decline after reviewing clearly stated deliverables, timelines, terms and expectations.

## Pitches and Templates
Pitches are outbound offers sent from Creators to Studios. 

If a Creator discovers a Studio or game title they want to work with, Creators can send pitches with creative ideas and requests.

An advanced feature of pitches will be pitch templates. Creators can share and save pitch templates for an easier outbound process.
