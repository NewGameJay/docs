Campaigns are Offers that have been accepted by both the Studio and Creator. The My Campaigns page will allow creators to track and understand the campaigns they've agreed to and the expectations. 

## Current Campaigns
Current campaigns are campaigns that are live and underway with incomplete deliverables.

Current Campaigns will contain information like the campaign brief, details about the game title, outstanding deliverables, and the Full Offer Value.

## Closed Campaigns
Closed Campaigns are campaigns that have been completed or cancelled. The My Campaigns feature will store campaign history for Creators and Studios to review.

#### Campaign Briefs
Campaign briefs will accompany Offers when sent to Creators. Included in Campaign Briefs will be the Event Details, Campaign Term, Compensation, Game Resources, Deliverables, and anything else the Studio wishes to include.

#### Campaign Changes
Any changes that are made after agreeing to the Campaign Terms must be approved by both the Creator and Studio. This includes any Campaign details, deliverables, timing, or compensation.

## Creator Performance
New Game+ offers creators in-depth analytics, including click-through rates, impressions, and engagement metrics, all accessible in the selected campaign details.

#### Tracking Links and Conversion Tools
Tracking links and analytics connections are available for each campaign, allowing both parties to track conversions, social engagements, and retention metrics across multiple platforms.

Depending on the campaign details, creators may be required to use New Game+ tracking links or analytics tools to gauge impact.

#### Customizable Reports
Creators can generate tailored reports on campaign performance, giving insight into conversions and audience reach.
