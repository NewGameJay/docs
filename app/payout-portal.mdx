In the past, Creators were forced to trust Studios to uphold their end of agreements after the work had been done and content had been shared. Studios are often left dissappointed when creators don't deliver high quality content or meaningful impact.

New Game+ solves this with the Payout Portal. When the completion of all deliverables and minimum targets are approved, funds will be automatically released to Creators.

## Initiating Payments
Studios can initiate payments in the Payout Portal through the various structures and payout solutions that best match the Campaign structure and term.

Prior to beginning a campaign and initiating payments, Studios will need to comply to New Game+ security measures and taxation policies.

### Payment Options

## Payment Claims
Creators can claim payments in the Payout Portal through the structure and payout solution outlined in the Campaign Brief.

Prior to completing a campaign and claining payments, Creators will need to comply to New Game+ security measures and taxation policies.

## Payment Disputes
Payment disputes, questions and concerns are sometimes unavoidable in influencer marketing. 

To ensure that Creators and Studios are upholding their end of the agreement, New Game+ will play an escrow management role. 

For funds to be released, Studios must first approve the completion of all deliverables and campaign requirements.

All payments in Escrow can be viewed by both parties and reported if there is any dispute or concern. Past claims and payouts can also be reviewed in the Payout Portal by both parties for tax use or payment confirmation.
