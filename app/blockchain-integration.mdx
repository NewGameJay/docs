Blockchain and AI Integration is going to be a focal point for the expansion of New Game+ beyond the planned traditional platform features.

### Onchain Verification

The goal is to ensure all blockchain features in the New Game+ app enhance ease of use or improve campaign success.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Custodial Wallets">
    When signing up, users are onboarded with custodial wallets that integrate seamlessly with the platform.

    These custodial wallets will act as gateways to New Game+ escrows and future contracts.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Onchain Escrow">
    Once both parties agree to an Offer, funds will need to be sent to the escrow account or contract to ensure payout security.

    Studios can initiate Onchain payments with their New Game+ custodial wallets through our developed Escrow Contract, audited and secured by Blockchain partners.

  <Tab title="More">
    Being inherently a web3 app, the sky is the limit in terms of the blockchain elements we incorporate.

    Future possibilities we've considered:

    > **$GAME Token and Semi-Fungible Utility**
    >
    > Airdropping ERC-721 tokens after Open Alpha testing based on usage and reputation.
    >
    > Bonding ERC-20s to create ERC-404 access passes that give Studios and Creators the ability to create Campaigns or use premium features.

    > **Wallet Tracking and Re-targeting**
    >
    > Tracking users through giveaways and game connections to understand the buying power and onchain activity of unique wallets.
    >
    > Partnering with notable web3 analytics tools to re-target those users with airdrops, WLs, and other incentives.

### The Game Bot +

New Game+ will leverage the accelerating tech of AI agents to build The Game Bot. By partnering with the leading developer team, *ai16z*, we will have access to build upon the lightweight AI agent framework, [eliza](https://ai16z.github.io/eliza/).

The Game Bot will be a modular, conversational AI agent that will be integrated throughout the New Game+ application.&#x20;

Users can have the ability to converse with The Game Bot through text, email, or in the app. Users will initiate actions through natural conversation, set reminders, get insights, and improve their marketing efforts through our extensive knowledge base.

The Game Bot is currently being trained to understand the application thoroughly and ingesting every campaign strategy as well as every consulting conversation New Game+ has had transcribed.

Features we plan to implement for New Game+ users:
