## What To Expect
As you explore the documentation and the New Game+ App, keep in mind that this React Application is in its first iteration of the build, developed by Josh Flores.

The design you will experience was expertly crafted by Matt Forrest.

The copy and messaging was a collaborative effort by Miles Lozano, Kyle Salazar, and Matt Forrest.

Our focus on the application development is possible because of the advisory by Thing3, Danny Carpio, Mark Mangianelli, Rich Cabrera, and Austin Mckee on all aspects of business, legal, and partnerships.


#### The New Game+ Profile
The New Game+ profiles were designed with growth in mind. We're aiming to build a robust user base in anticipation of our platform's Alpha launch. 

<img

  src="/images/hero-light.svg"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/hero-dark.svg"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

Users with New Game+ profiles can customize and share their profile as a showcase of their creator experience or game titles.

By onboarding creators and studios early, we're gauging interest and getting an understanding of the core features users want to see.
